/*
Count all possible paths between two vertices

Count the total number of ways or paths that exist between two vertices in a directed graph. These paths donâ€™t contain a cycle, the simple enough reason is that a cycle contains an infinite number of paths and hence they create a problem.

Examples:

For the following Graph: (pic is available in computer)

  
Input: Count paths between A and E
Output : Total paths between A and E are 4
Explanation: The 4 paths between A and E are:
                      A -> E
                      A -> B -> E
                      A -> C -> E
                      A -> B -> D -> C -> E 

Input : Count paths between A and C
Output : Total paths between A and C are 2
Explanation: The 2 paths between A and C are:
                      A -> C
                      A -> B -> D -> C*/
