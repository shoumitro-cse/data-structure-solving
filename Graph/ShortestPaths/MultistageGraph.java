Multistage Graph (Shortest Path)


A Multistage graph is a directed graph in which the nodes can be divided into a set of stages 
such that all edges are from a stage to next stage only (In other words there is no edge between 
vertices of same stage and from a vertex of current stage to previous stage).

We are give a multistage graph, a source and a destination, we need to find shortest path from 
source to destination. By convention, we consider source at stage 1 and destination as last stage.

Following is an example graph we will consider in this article :- (pic)







Shortest distance from stage 1, node 0 to 
destination, i.e., 7 is M(1, 0).

// From 0, we can go to 1 or 2 or 3 to
// reach 7.              
M(1, 0) = min(1 + M(2, 1),
              2 + M(2, 2),
              5 + M(2, 3))
This means that our problem of 0 â€”> 7 is now sub-divided into 3 sub-problems :-

So if we have total 'n' stages and target
as T, then the stopping condition  will be :-
M(n-1, i) = i ---> T + M(n, T) = i ---> T
Recursion Tree and Overlapping Sub-Problems:-
So, the hierarchy of M(x, y) evaluations will look something like this :-

In M(i, j), i is stage number and
j is node number

                   M(1, 0)
           /          |         \                             
          /           |          \                            
       M(2, 1)      M(2, 2)        M(2, 3)
    /      \        /     \         /    \
M(3, 4)  M(3, 5)  M(3, 4)  M(3, 5) M(3, 6)  M(3, 6)
 .         .       .       .          .        .
 .         .       .       .          .        .
 .         .       .       .          .        .
So, here we have drawn a very small part of the Recursion Tree and we can already see Overlapping Sub-Problems. We can largely reduce the number of M(x, y) evaluations using Dynamic Programming.
