Complexity Analysis: 

Time Complexity: O(2^(n^2)). 
   The recursion can run upper-bound 2^(n^2) times.
Space Complexity: O(n^2). 
   Output matrix is required so an extra space of size n*n is needed.

 Rat in a Maze | Backtracking-2

We have discussed Backtracking and Knight’s tour problem in Set 1. Let us discuss Rat in a Maze 
as another example problem that can be solved using Backtracking.

A Maze is given as N*N binary matrix of blocks where source block is the upper left most block 
i.e., maze[0][0] and destination block is lower rightmost block i.e., maze[N-1][N-1]. 
A rat starts from source and has to reach the destination. The rat can move only in two 
directions: forward and down. 

In the maze matrix, 0 means the block is a dead end and 1 means the block can be used in the path
 from source to destination. Note that this is a simple version of the typical Maze problem. 
 For example, a more complex version can be that the rat can move in 4 directions and a more 
 complex version can be with a limited number of moves.

Following is an example maze.  

 Gray blocks are dead ends (value = 0).

Following is binary matrix representation of the above maze. 

{1, 0, 0, 0}
{1, 1, 0, 1}
{0, 1, 0, 0}
{1, 1, 1, 1}


Following is a maze with highlighted solution path.

Following is the solution matrix (output of program) for the above input matrix. 

{1, 0, 0, 0}
{1, 1, 0, 0}
{0, 1, 0, 0}
{0, 1, 1, 1}
All enteries in solution path are marked as 1.
